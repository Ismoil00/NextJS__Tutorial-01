PRE-RENDERING:

1. SSG (Static Site Generation);

2. SSG with fetching static data at build time:
  *We use "getStaticProps()" - async function to fetch static data before runtime;

3. SSG with fetching dynamic data at runtime:
  *Using getStaticPaths we can make different an API calls at build/run times using it for dynamic routing;
